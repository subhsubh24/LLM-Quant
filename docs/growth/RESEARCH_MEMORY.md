## 2026-06-27 — Bootstrap (no alphas tested yet)
- Hypothesis (falsifiable): n/a — apparatus bootstrap only.
- Min sample N: n/a
- OOS result: none. No validated out-of-sample edge exists yet.
- Calibration: not yet measured.
- Costs modeled: cost model not yet asserted in backtest (ROADMAP C2 open).
- Verdict: edge-not-proven (baseline)
- Why: This run installed the factory apparatus and the gated live path; it did not
  test any alpha. The first research run should diagnose the binding constraint
  (likely: no leakage-free cost-realistic OOS backtest yet) and propose the first
  falsifiable experiment with a stated minimum sample size.

## 2026-06-28 — Backtest + calibration APPARATUS built (C1/C3 engine, B2 eval) — no alpha tested
- Hypothesis (falsifiable): n/a — this run built the MEASUREMENT apparatus the binding
  constraint requires, not an alpha. The prior entries correctly named the constraint as
  "no leakage-free cost-realistic OOS backtest + no calibration eval"; this run builds both.
- Min sample N: the B2 eval now ENFORCES significance — `passes` requires a paired-bootstrap
  CI on the per-market Brier difference to exclude 0 (default 95% CI, ≥30 samples). A raw
  Brier point comparison was measured to pass ~21% of pure-noise strategies at N=30; the
  bootstrap gate collapses that to ≤1.2%. **No alpha may be promoted on a sub-significance
  Brier win.** Multiple-comparison correction (tighten alpha) is required when screening >1.
- OOS result: none. The walk_forward engine runs on SYNTHETIC data only — it proves the
  engine is leakage-free (structural: the decision can't see the outcome), reproduces
  deterministically, recovers a known injected edge, and reports ~0 on a no-edge market. It
  does NOT prove a real edge. No real resolved-Polymarket history is wired yet.
- Calibration (Brier / reliability): the eval EXISTS (Brier + reliability curve + ECE +
  significance gate) but has not been run on real resolved markets / live strategy
  probabilities — so there is no passing calibration result to report yet.
- Costs modeled: yes — the walk_forward engine prices every fill through `cost_model`
  (same source as the executor; C2 unify makes execution.py import those rates too).
- Verdict: edge-not-proven (apparatus only) — the gate to test the FIRST real alpha is now
  built and adversarially hardened.
- Why / next: the binding constraint is unchanged — a VALIDATED out-of-sample weekly-PnL
  series on REAL resolved markets + a passing calibration eval on live strategy probabilities.
  Next research run: wire real resolved-Polymarket history into `walk_forward` + run B2 on
  the strategies' historical probabilities; only then can the first alpha be proposed →
  backtested → significance-tested. Until then, every candidate below stays a hypothesis.

## 2026-06-28 — Cost-aware sizing (C2): gross-edge Kelly was systematically over-betting
- Hypothesis (falsifiable): the orchestrator's Kelly sized on GROSS edge
  (`win_probability - market_price`), ignoring the executor's fees (2% of notional) +
  market-order slippage (0.5%). Claim: this both over-bets (full-Kelly on inflated odds)
  and over-trades (takes positions whose gross edge is positive but net edge ≤ 0).
- Min sample N: n/a (deterministic correctness fix, not an alpha).
- OOS result: n/a — no edge claimed. This LOWERS expected turnover/sizing (honestly).
- Costs modeled: NOW yes — `cost_model.py` is the single source of truth
  (effective_buy_price = price·(1+slip)·(1+fee); net_edge; contracts_for_budget). Verified
  end-to-end that net cash deployed == intended budget (no double-counting) and that a 1%
  gross edge at price 0.50 is now correctly REJECTED (net edge negative).
- Verdict: promoted (correctness fix; 10 tests + 3 adversarial auditors SOUND).
- Why / next: this is a prerequisite for honest realized-vs-backtest reconciliation —
  EV must subtract the same costs realized fills do. REMAINING: model liquidity/market
  impact; apply the cost model inside the walk-forward backtest (C1/C3); unify
  `execution.py` to import the cost_model rates (currently duplicated literals + a drift
  test). Until the cost model also covers depth/impact, capacity claims stay conservative.

### Candidate alpha directions to investigate (not yet tested — hypotheses only)
- **Calibration arbitrage:** crowd probabilities on low-liquidity markets may be
  systematically mis-calibrated near 0/1; test reliability vs realized outcomes with
  sufficient N before claiming anything.
- **Cross-market logical constraints:** mutually exclusive / implied markets that
  violate probability axioms (sum > 1 net of fees). Already partially present
  (`logical_implication`); needs OOS validation + cost realism.
- **Resolution-timing edges:** price drift as resolution approaches; must rule out
  look-ahead and liquidity traps.
All of the above are **hypotheses**, not edges. None may be promoted without OOS +
calibration + cost-realistic validation surviving the adversarial auditors.
