## 2026-06-27 — Bootstrap (no alphas tested yet)
- Hypothesis (falsifiable): n/a — apparatus bootstrap only.
- Min sample N: n/a
- OOS result: none. No validated out-of-sample edge exists yet.
- Calibration: not yet measured.
- Costs modeled: cost model not yet asserted in backtest (ROADMAP C2 open).
- Verdict: edge-not-proven (baseline)
- Why: This run installed the factory apparatus and the gated live path; it did not
  test any alpha. The first research run should diagnose the binding constraint
  (likely: no leakage-free cost-realistic OOS backtest yet) and propose the first
  falsifiable experiment with a stated minimum sample size.

## 2026-06-28 — Backtest + calibration APPARATUS built (C1/C3 engine, B2 eval) — no alpha tested
- Hypothesis (falsifiable): n/a — this run built the MEASUREMENT apparatus the binding
  constraint requires, not an alpha. The prior entries correctly named the constraint as
  "no leakage-free cost-realistic OOS backtest + no calibration eval"; this run builds both.
- Min sample N: the B2 eval now ENFORCES significance — `passes` requires a paired-bootstrap
  CI on the per-market Brier difference to exclude 0 (default 95% CI, ≥30 samples). A raw
  Brier point comparison was measured to pass ~21% of pure-noise strategies at N=30; the
  bootstrap gate collapses that to ≤1.2%. **No alpha may be promoted on a sub-significance
  Brier win.** Multiple-comparison correction (tighten alpha) is required when screening >1.
- OOS result: none. The walk_forward engine runs on SYNTHETIC data only — it proves the
  engine is leakage-free (structural: the decision can't see the outcome), reproduces
  deterministically, recovers a known injected edge, and reports ~0 on a no-edge market. It
  does NOT prove a real edge. No real resolved-Polymarket history is wired yet.
- Calibration (Brier / reliability): the eval EXISTS (Brier + reliability curve + ECE +
  significance gate) but has not been run on real resolved markets / live strategy
  probabilities — so there is no passing calibration result to report yet.
- Costs modeled: yes — the walk_forward engine prices every fill through `cost_model`
  (same source as the executor; C2 unify makes execution.py import those rates too).
- Verdict: edge-not-proven (apparatus only) — the gate to test the FIRST real alpha is now
  built and adversarially hardened.
- Why / next: the binding constraint is unchanged — a VALIDATED out-of-sample weekly-PnL
  series on REAL resolved markets + a passing calibration eval on live strategy probabilities.
  Next research run: wire real resolved-Polymarket history into `walk_forward` + run B2 on
  the strategies' historical probabilities; only then can the first alpha be proposed →
  backtested → significance-tested. Until then, every candidate below stays a hypothesis.

## 2026-06-28 — Cost-aware sizing (C2): gross-edge Kelly was systematically over-betting
- Hypothesis (falsifiable): the orchestrator's Kelly sized on GROSS edge
  (`win_probability - market_price`), ignoring the executor's fees (2% of notional) +
  market-order slippage (0.5%). Claim: this both over-bets (full-Kelly on inflated odds)
  and over-trades (takes positions whose gross edge is positive but net edge ≤ 0).
- Min sample N: n/a (deterministic correctness fix, not an alpha).
- OOS result: n/a — no edge claimed. This LOWERS expected turnover/sizing (honestly).
- Costs modeled: NOW yes — `cost_model.py` is the single source of truth
  (effective_buy_price = price·(1+slip)·(1+fee); net_edge; contracts_for_budget). Verified
  end-to-end that net cash deployed == intended budget (no double-counting) and that a 1%
  gross edge at price 0.50 is now correctly REJECTED (net edge negative).
- Verdict: promoted (correctness fix; 10 tests + 3 adversarial auditors SOUND).
- Why / next: this is a prerequisite for honest realized-vs-backtest reconciliation —
  EV must subtract the same costs realized fills do. REMAINING: model liquidity/market
  impact; apply the cost model inside the walk-forward backtest (C1/C3); unify
  `execution.py` to import the cost_model rates (currently duplicated literals + a drift
  test). Until the cost model also covers depth/impact, capacity claims stay conservative.

### Candidate alpha directions to investigate (not yet tested — hypotheses only)
- **Calibration arbitrage:** crowd probabilities on low-liquidity markets may be
  systematically mis-calibrated near 0/1; test reliability vs realized outcomes with
  sufficient N before claiming anything.
- **Cross-market logical constraints:** mutually exclusive / implied markets that
  violate probability axioms (sum > 1 net of fees). Already partially present
  (`logical_implication`); needs OOS validation + cost realism.
- **Resolution-timing edges:** price drift as resolution approaches; must rule out
  look-ahead and liquidity traps.
All of the above are **hypotheses**, not edges. None may be promoted without OOS +
calibration + cost-realistic validation surviving the adversarial auditors.

## 2026-06-28 — Research Run 3: Real-data pipeline gap identified; EXP-001 proposed

- Hypothesis (falsifiable): The NO Position Scanner generates positive net EV —
  Brier improvement vs crowd baseline AND positive net PnL after realistic costs —
  on resolved Polymarket binary markets where YES > 90¢, across ≥100 resolved
  markets spanning ≥3 market categories. Category-specific reversal base rates
  (politics 2%, economics 3%, crypto 8%, sports 5%) are empirically calibrated to
  real resolution history, not hardcoded fiction.
- Min sample N: 100 resolved markets total; ≥50 per category for any
  category-level significance claim.
- OOS result: **insufficient data** — no real resolved Polymarket history in the
  system yet. `polymarket_client.py` has no method to batch-fetch historical
  resolved markets. Third-party APIs (PMData: pmdata.dev; PolyHistorical:
  polyhistorical.com; PolymarketData: polymarketdata.co) offer 13K–200K+ resolved
  markets suitable for populating `HistoricalMarket` records. This is the blocking
  dependency for ALL OOS validation.
- Calibration (Brier / reliability): not measured — no real data. The eval (B2
  calibration.py) exists and is significance-gated; it has never run on real
  resolved-market probabilities.
- Costs modeled: yes (cost_model.py: 2% fee + 0.5% slippage). No
  liquidity/market-impact model yet — near-certainty NO positions may have
  near-zero book depth on the NO side, making slippage estimates conservative.
- Verdict: **proposed** (EXP-001; see GROWTH_STATUS experiments[])
- Why: Research confirmed (a) third-party resolved-market data sources exist and
  are credible; (b) all 11 existing strategies are untested hypotheses; (c) the NO
  Position Scanner is the most tractable first OOS test — a single calibration
  question (are the reversal rates real?). Cross-market arb (Polymarket/Kalshi) is
  a real structural edge ($40M captured 2024-2025) but bot-speed-dominated —
  unlikely to be our first competitive advantage. Academic evidence (Le 2026,
  210K+ Kalshi contracts) confirms domain-specific calibration differences persist
  but spreads are compressing 43% as market volume grows — the efficiency window
  is closing. The "horizon effect" (long-dated markets underpriced vs near-term)
  has academic backing but limited near-resolution actionability.

### How EXP-001 could be wrong (adversarial pre-mortem)
1. Reversal rates empirically near-zero across all categories → strategy dead on
   arrival; current parameters over-trade relative to the real base rate.
2. Near-certainty NO books are illiquid → real slippage far exceeds the modeled
   0.5%, erasing the edge.
3. Survivorship bias in third-party archives: contested/re-resolved/cancelled
   markets may be excluded, making the dataset unrepresentative of real outcomes.
4. N per category < 50 even with 100+ total → cannot make category-level
   statistical claims; must report "insufficient data" per category.
5. Market efficiency has increased since early Polymarket data — historical
   calibration edge may be gone in recent months.

### Candidate alphas NOT proposed this run (reasons)
- **Cross-market arb (Polymarket/Kalshi):** Real but execution-speed-dominated;
  "insufficient data" on whether paper-simulator latency can capture it.
- **Whale copy-trading:** Depends on on-chain wallet tracking — data availability
  unconfirmed; auto-rejects under "private data" exclusion if wallet identities
  are non-public.
- **Weather Arb:** Interesting but niche; NOAA integration needs validation before
  any edge claim.
- **Horizon effect (long-dated miscalibration):** Academic evidence for Kalshi
  (2021-2025); no Polymarket-specific confirmation; propose after EXP-001 gives
  baseline calibration measurement.

## 2026-06-28 — EXP-001 code blocker CLEARED (history fetcher built); real-data run is now EGRESS-blocked
- Hypothesis (falsifiable): unchanged — EXP-001 (NO Position Scanner / crowd-miscalibration
  on resolved binary markets) still needs a real OOS run before it can pass or be retired.
- Min sample N: unchanged (100 resolved markets; ≥50/category for category claims).
- OOS result: **still insufficient data — but the blocker moved from CODE to ENVIRONMENT.**
  Built `polymarket_history_fetcher.py` (leakage-safe ingest of real resolved markets + a
  PRE-resolution price snapshot) using Polymarket's OWN public Gamma `closed=true` + CLOB
  `prices-history` endpoints — so no third-party archive / key is needed (PMData/PolyHistorical
  not required). The fetcher is the named blocking dependency for ALL OOS validation, and it
  is now done + fixture-tested + 3-Opus-auditor-clean. **HOWEVER:** the autonomous build env's
  network egress policy BLOCKS Polymarket (403 at the proxy for gamma-api.polymarket.com /
  clob.polymarket.com), so the loop cannot actually pull real history here. Real-data OOS is
  now PENDING_OPS OA-11 (owner runs the fetcher where Polymarket is reachable, or widens egress).
- Calibration (Brier / reliability): not measured — still no real data to run B2 on.
- Costs modeled: yes + IMPROVED — added a conservative sqrt market-impact / order-book-depth
  model (`cost_model.effective_buy_price_with_impact`) applied size-aware inside the
  walk-forward backtest, so a large order in a thin "near-certainty NO" book now pays realistic
  impact (the prior audit's "illiquid NO book erases the edge" concern). Still a non-calibrated
  toy until real OrderBook depth is wired.
- Verdict: **proposed (unchanged)** — EXP-001 cannot pass/retire until the real fetch runs.
- Why / next: the binding constraint is now ENVIRONMENTAL, not a missing capability. The
  cheapest path to a first honest OOS measurement is OA-11: run the (already-built) fetcher
  against live Polymarket public data, feed `scripts/run_walk_forward.py` + the B2 eval, and
  report OOS Brier + PnL with the bootstrap CI. ADVERSARIAL PRE-MORTEM addition: the fetcher's
  "unambiguously settled" filter EXCLUDES contested/re-resolved/UMA-disputed markets, biasing
  the sample toward clean crowd-friendly outcomes — any first eval MUST disclose this so it
  doesn't silently overstate crowd calibration (now documented in the fetcher itself).

## 2026-06-29 — Forensic audit of existing cross-market alphas + metrics wired e2e (no new edge)
- Hypothesis (falsifiable): the existing cross-market logical-consistency alphas
  (`CrossMarketArbitrageStrategy`, `LogicalImplicationDetector`) actually fire and find
  real, exploitable mispricing on real-shaped resolved data.
- Min sample N: 54 real resolved records (the committed leakage-safe fixture).
- OOS result: **0 signals fired** on the real sample. The records carry NO real question
  text and NO related-market grouping, which both alphas require to fire. So they are
  effectively dormant on this individual-record, near-resolution, high-liquidity sample.
- Calibration (Brier / reliability): crowd baseline Brier ≈ 0.0933 (re-confirmed,
  reproducible, no look-ahead — `scripts/validate_real_history.py`); no model edge measured
  (model_prob == crowd → degenerate, honestly reported, NOT a fake pass).
- Costs modeled: yes (cost_model; the audit is forensic, no fitting on the sample).
- Verdict: **edge-not-proven** (forensic groundwork only). Built a reusable, deterministic
  audit harness (`strategy_audit.py`) + wired weekly-metrics + calibration end-to-end into
  the paper run + API (#56), so the moment a real alpha exists it is measured honestly.
- **Adversarial-audit finding (a real strategy weakness, recorded for B-track):** a first
  cut of the audit loader injected IDENTICAL boilerplate question text ("Market {id} (real
  sample)") into all 54 records; the `CrossMarketArbitrageStrategy` keyword screen fires on
  "3+ shared non-trivial words", so it spuriously paired completely unrelated markets and
  produced ~98 PHANTOM signals (forensically "scored" at a 64% hit rate) while the prose
  claimed 0. An Opus honesty auditor broke the claim. Fixed in the harness (unique opaque
  placeholders → genuine 0 signals, enforced by a loud regression test). **The deeper lesson:
  the strategy's keyword screen is too weak — filler/boilerplate words pass the "shared
  words" test. A future B-track fix must require shared CONTENT words (stop-word list /
  entity overlap) before pairing markets, with tests. The strategy itself was left untouched
  this run (behavior change needs its own deliberate work).**
- Why / next: the binding constraint is unchanged and loop-buildable — a real decision-time
  alpha that forms `model_prob != crowd` on LESS-PINNED markets (sampled earlier in market
  life). The measurement apparatus (metrics e2e, calibration honesty, reproduction canary,
  audit harness) is now in place to evaluate it the moment it exists. No DoD/floor box ticked.
