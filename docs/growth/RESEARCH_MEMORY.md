## 2026-06-27 — Bootstrap (no alphas tested yet)
- Hypothesis (falsifiable): n/a — apparatus bootstrap only.
- Min sample N: n/a
- OOS result: none. No validated out-of-sample edge exists yet.
- Calibration: not yet measured.
- Costs modeled: cost model not yet asserted in backtest (ROADMAP C2 open).
- Verdict: edge-not-proven (baseline)
- Why: This run installed the factory apparatus and the gated live path; it did not
  test any alpha. The first research run should diagnose the binding constraint
  (likely: no leakage-free cost-realistic OOS backtest yet) and propose the first
  falsifiable experiment with a stated minimum sample size.

## 2026-06-28 — Backtest + calibration APPARATUS built (C1/C3 engine, B2 eval) — no alpha tested
- Hypothesis (falsifiable): n/a — this run built the MEASUREMENT apparatus the binding
  constraint requires, not an alpha. The prior entries correctly named the constraint as
  "no leakage-free cost-realistic OOS backtest + no calibration eval"; this run builds both.
- Min sample N: the B2 eval now ENFORCES significance — `passes` requires a paired-bootstrap
  CI on the per-market Brier difference to exclude 0 (default 95% CI, ≥30 samples). A raw
  Brier point comparison was measured to pass ~21% of pure-noise strategies at N=30; the
  bootstrap gate collapses that to ≤1.2%. **No alpha may be promoted on a sub-significance
  Brier win.** Multiple-comparison correction (tighten alpha) is required when screening >1.
- OOS result: none. The walk_forward engine runs on SYNTHETIC data only — it proves the
  engine is leakage-free (structural: the decision can't see the outcome), reproduces
  deterministically, recovers a known injected edge, and reports ~0 on a no-edge market. It
  does NOT prove a real edge. No real resolved-Polymarket history is wired yet.
- Calibration (Brier / reliability): the eval EXISTS (Brier + reliability curve + ECE +
  significance gate) but has not been run on real resolved markets / live strategy
  probabilities — so there is no passing calibration result to report yet.
- Costs modeled: yes — the walk_forward engine prices every fill through `cost_model`
  (same source as the executor; C2 unify makes execution.py import those rates too).
- Verdict: edge-not-proven (apparatus only) — the gate to test the FIRST real alpha is now
  built and adversarially hardened.
- Why / next: the binding constraint is unchanged — a VALIDATED out-of-sample weekly-PnL
  series on REAL resolved markets + a passing calibration eval on live strategy probabilities.
  Next research run: wire real resolved-Polymarket history into `walk_forward` + run B2 on
  the strategies' historical probabilities; only then can the first alpha be proposed →
  backtested → significance-tested. Until then, every candidate below stays a hypothesis.

## 2026-06-28 — Cost-aware sizing (C2): gross-edge Kelly was systematically over-betting
- Hypothesis (falsifiable): the orchestrator's Kelly sized on GROSS edge
  (`win_probability - market_price`), ignoring the executor's fees (2% of notional) +
  market-order slippage (0.5%). Claim: this both over-bets (full-Kelly on inflated odds)
  and over-trades (takes positions whose gross edge is positive but net edge ≤ 0).
- Min sample N: n/a (deterministic correctness fix, not an alpha).
- OOS result: n/a — no edge claimed. This LOWERS expected turnover/sizing (honestly).
- Costs modeled: NOW yes — `cost_model.py` is the single source of truth
  (effective_buy_price = price·(1+slip)·(1+fee); net_edge; contracts_for_budget). Verified
  end-to-end that net cash deployed == intended budget (no double-counting) and that a 1%
  gross edge at price 0.50 is now correctly REJECTED (net edge negative).
- Verdict: promoted (correctness fix; 10 tests + 3 adversarial auditors SOUND).
- Why / next: this is a prerequisite for honest realized-vs-backtest reconciliation —
  EV must subtract the same costs realized fills do. REMAINING: model liquidity/market
  impact; apply the cost model inside the walk-forward backtest (C1/C3); unify
  `execution.py` to import the cost_model rates (currently duplicated literals + a drift
  test). Until the cost model also covers depth/impact, capacity claims stay conservative.

### Candidate alpha directions to investigate (not yet tested — hypotheses only)
- **Calibration arbitrage:** crowd probabilities on low-liquidity markets may be
  systematically mis-calibrated near 0/1; test reliability vs realized outcomes with
  sufficient N before claiming anything.
- **Cross-market logical constraints:** mutually exclusive / implied markets that
  violate probability axioms (sum > 1 net of fees). Already partially present
  (`logical_implication`); needs OOS validation + cost realism.
- **Resolution-timing edges:** price drift as resolution approaches; must rule out
  look-ahead and liquidity traps.
All of the above are **hypotheses**, not edges. None may be promoted without OOS +
calibration + cost-realistic validation surviving the adversarial auditors.

## 2026-06-28 — Research Run 3: Real-data pipeline gap identified; EXP-001 proposed

- Hypothesis (falsifiable): The NO Position Scanner generates positive net EV —
  Brier improvement vs crowd baseline AND positive net PnL after realistic costs —
  on resolved Polymarket binary markets where YES > 90¢, across ≥100 resolved
  markets spanning ≥3 market categories. Category-specific reversal base rates
  (politics 2%, economics 3%, crypto 8%, sports 5%) are empirically calibrated to
  real resolution history, not hardcoded fiction.
- Min sample N: 100 resolved markets total; ≥50 per category for any
  category-level significance claim.
- OOS result: **insufficient data** — no real resolved Polymarket history in the
  system yet. `polymarket_client.py` has no method to batch-fetch historical
  resolved markets. Third-party APIs (PMData: pmdata.dev; PolyHistorical:
  polyhistorical.com; PolymarketData: polymarketdata.co) offer 13K–200K+ resolved
  markets suitable for populating `HistoricalMarket` records. This is the blocking
  dependency for ALL OOS validation.
- Calibration (Brier / reliability): not measured — no real data. The eval (B2
  calibration.py) exists and is significance-gated; it has never run on real
  resolved-market probabilities.
- Costs modeled: yes (cost_model.py: 2% fee + 0.5% slippage). No
  liquidity/market-impact model yet — near-certainty NO positions may have
  near-zero book depth on the NO side, making slippage estimates conservative.
- Verdict: **proposed** (EXP-001; see GROWTH_STATUS experiments[])
- Why: Research confirmed (a) third-party resolved-market data sources exist and
  are credible; (b) all 11 existing strategies are untested hypotheses; (c) the NO
  Position Scanner is the most tractable first OOS test — a single calibration
  question (are the reversal rates real?). Cross-market arb (Polymarket/Kalshi) is
  a real structural edge ($40M captured 2024-2025) but bot-speed-dominated —
  unlikely to be our first competitive advantage. Academic evidence (Le 2026,
  210K+ Kalshi contracts) confirms domain-specific calibration differences persist
  but spreads are compressing 43% as market volume grows — the efficiency window
  is closing. The "horizon effect" (long-dated markets underpriced vs near-term)
  has academic backing but limited near-resolution actionability.

### How EXP-001 could be wrong (adversarial pre-mortem)
1. Reversal rates empirically near-zero across all categories → strategy dead on
   arrival; current parameters over-trade relative to the real base rate.
2. Near-certainty NO books are illiquid → real slippage far exceeds the modeled
   0.5%, erasing the edge.
3. Survivorship bias in third-party archives: contested/re-resolved/cancelled
   markets may be excluded, making the dataset unrepresentative of real outcomes.
4. N per category < 50 even with 100+ total → cannot make category-level
   statistical claims; must report "insufficient data" per category.
5. Market efficiency has increased since early Polymarket data — historical
   calibration edge may be gone in recent months.

### Candidate alphas NOT proposed this run (reasons)
- **Cross-market arb (Polymarket/Kalshi):** Real but execution-speed-dominated;
  "insufficient data" on whether paper-simulator latency can capture it.
- **Whale copy-trading:** Depends on on-chain wallet tracking — data availability
  unconfirmed; auto-rejects under "private data" exclusion if wallet identities
  are non-public.
- **Weather Arb:** Interesting but niche; NOAA integration needs validation before
  any edge claim.
- **Horizon effect (long-dated miscalibration):** Academic evidence for Kalshi
  (2021-2025); no Polymarket-specific confirmation; propose after EXP-001 gives
  baseline calibration measurement.

## 2026-06-28 — EXP-001 code blocker CLEARED (history fetcher built); real-data run is now EGRESS-blocked
- Hypothesis (falsifiable): unchanged — EXP-001 (NO Position Scanner / crowd-miscalibration
  on resolved binary markets) still needs a real OOS run before it can pass or be retired.
- Min sample N: unchanged (100 resolved markets; ≥50/category for category claims).
- OOS result: **still insufficient data — but the blocker moved from CODE to ENVIRONMENT.**
  Built `polymarket_history_fetcher.py` (leakage-safe ingest of real resolved markets + a
  PRE-resolution price snapshot) using Polymarket's OWN public Gamma `closed=true` + CLOB
  `prices-history` endpoints — so no third-party archive / key is needed (PMData/PolyHistorical
  not required). The fetcher is the named blocking dependency for ALL OOS validation, and it
  is now done + fixture-tested + 3-Opus-auditor-clean. **HOWEVER:** the autonomous build env's
  network egress policy BLOCKS Polymarket (403 at the proxy for gamma-api.polymarket.com /
  clob.polymarket.com), so the loop cannot actually pull real history here. Real-data OOS is
  now PENDING_OPS OA-11 (owner runs the fetcher where Polymarket is reachable, or widens egress).
- Calibration (Brier / reliability): not measured — still no real data to run B2 on.
- Costs modeled: yes + IMPROVED — added a conservative sqrt market-impact / order-book-depth
  model (`cost_model.effective_buy_price_with_impact`) applied size-aware inside the
  walk-forward backtest, so a large order in a thin "near-certainty NO" book now pays realistic
  impact (the prior audit's "illiquid NO book erases the edge" concern). Still a non-calibrated
  toy until real OrderBook depth is wired.
- Verdict: **proposed (unchanged)** — EXP-001 cannot pass/retire until the real fetch runs.
- Why / next: the binding constraint is now ENVIRONMENTAL, not a missing capability. The
  cheapest path to a first honest OOS measurement is OA-11: run the (already-built) fetcher
  against live Polymarket public data, feed `scripts/run_walk_forward.py` + the B2 eval, and
  report OOS Brier + PnL with the bootstrap CI. ADVERSARIAL PRE-MORTEM addition: the fetcher's
  "unambiguously settled" filter EXCLUDES contested/re-resolved/UMA-disputed markets, biasing
  the sample toward clean crowd-friendly outcomes — any first eval MUST disclose this so it
  doesn't silently overstate crowd calibration (now documented in the fetcher itself).

## 2026-06-29 — Forensic audit of existing cross-market alphas + metrics wired e2e (no new edge)
- Hypothesis (falsifiable): the existing cross-market logical-consistency alphas
  (`CrossMarketArbitrageStrategy`, `LogicalImplicationDetector`) actually fire and find
  real, exploitable mispricing on real-shaped resolved data.
- Min sample N: 54 real resolved records (the committed leakage-safe fixture).
- OOS result: **0 signals fired** on the real sample. The records carry NO real question
  text and NO related-market grouping, which both alphas require to fire. So they are
  effectively dormant on this individual-record, near-resolution, high-liquidity sample.
- Calibration (Brier / reliability): crowd baseline Brier ≈ 0.0933 (re-confirmed,
  reproducible, no look-ahead — `scripts/validate_real_history.py`); no model edge measured
  (model_prob == crowd → degenerate, honestly reported, NOT a fake pass).
- Costs modeled: yes (cost_model; the audit is forensic, no fitting on the sample).
- Verdict: **edge-not-proven** (forensic groundwork only). Built a reusable, deterministic
  audit harness (`strategy_audit.py`) + wired weekly-metrics + calibration end-to-end into
  the paper run + API (#56), so the moment a real alpha exists it is measured honestly.
- **Adversarial-audit finding (a real strategy weakness, recorded for B-track):** a first
  cut of the audit loader injected IDENTICAL boilerplate question text ("Market {id} (real
  sample)") into all 54 records; the `CrossMarketArbitrageStrategy` keyword screen fires on
  "3+ shared non-trivial words", so it spuriously paired completely unrelated markets and
  produced ~98 PHANTOM signals (forensically "scored" at a 64% hit rate) while the prose
  claimed 0. An Opus honesty auditor broke the claim. Fixed in the harness (unique opaque
  placeholders → genuine 0 signals, enforced by a loud regression test). **The deeper lesson:
  the strategy's keyword screen is too weak — filler/boilerplate words pass the "shared
  words" test. A future B-track fix must require shared CONTENT words (stop-word list /
  entity overlap) before pairing markets, with tests. The strategy itself was left untouched
  this run (behavior change needs its own deliberate work).**
- Why / next: the binding constraint is unchanged and loop-buildable — a real decision-time
  alpha that forms `model_prob != crowd` on LESS-PINNED markets (sampled earlier in market
  life). The measurement apparatus (metrics e2e, calibration honesty, reproduction canary,
  audit harness) is now in place to evaluate it the moment it exists. No DoD/floor box ticked.

## 2026-06-29 — B5 keyword-screen hardened + B2 anti-p-hacking + B3/E6 learning-loop engines (4-PR run)
- Hypothesis (falsifiable): the cross-market keyword relatedness screen can be made to
  reject unrelated markets (boilerplate-shared AND same-template/different-subject) WITHOUT
  losing genuinely-related pairs — closing the phantom-signal weakness logged 2026-06-29.
- Min sample N: n/a (deterministic strategy-quality + infra change, not an alpha eval).
- OOS result: n/a — no edge claimed. This run hardens the SCREEN + builds learning-loop
  engines (lifecycle registry, per-strategy attribution) + strengthens the calibration gate.
- Calibration (Brier / reliability): unchanged; the B2 module now ENFORCES a Bonferroni
  multiple-comparison correction (`evaluate_calibration(strategies_screened=K)` →
  `effective_alpha=alpha/K`) so screening K strategies can no longer p-hack a pass. Verified
  the correction only ever TIGHTENS (monotone, 0 False→True flips across thousands of datasets,
  2 independent Opus auditors).
- Costs modeled: n/a for these changes.
- Verdict: promoted (strategy-quality + integrity + learning-loop infra; 4 file-disjoint PRs
  #63/#64/#65/#66 merged, gate green, 2 fix cycles vs 5 reviewers/auditors).
- **THE adversarial lesson (the keyword screen is a heuristic — entity-gating was whack-a-mole):**
  A first hardening cut required ≥3 shared content tokens AND ≥1 shared "entity" (capitalized
  proper noun). A fresh Opus auditor BROKE it both ways: it still paired same-template pairs that
  share a capitalized VENUE/NATIONALITY/ROLE word (Apple-vs-Tesla "on the Nasdaq", "Chinese mfg"
  vs "Chinese spending"), AND it wrongly REJECTED real pairs whose only entity was a <4-char
  acronym dropped by the length floor (NBA, Fed). The robust fix was SIMPLER, not more clever:
  drop entity detection entirely and rely on a COMPREHENSIVE stopword set — once the template
  words (approval/rating/exceed/percent/December/stock/dollars/nasdaq/chinese/…) are filler,
  same-template/different-subject questions share ZERO content tokens and reject naturally.
  **Lesson: a relatedness heuristic on free text is inherently leaky; chasing perfect entity
  detection is whack-a-mole. The honest, robust move is a broad stopword list + an explicit
  "this is a conservative SECONDARY screen, not an exact classifier" disclosure, accepting
  conservative false negatives (the SAFE direction) over fabricated cross-market signals.**
- **Learning-loop engines (B3/E6) — built PURE, not wired:** strategy_registry.py (lifecycle
  state machine, fail-loud integrity gate: promotion impossible without recorded backtest+OOS+
  calibration evidence) + per_strategy_metrics.py (per-strategy realized-PnL attribution; no
  fabricated rows; reconciles to total). The integrity gate operationalizes "no alpha ships while
  integrity is weak" as code. Auditors could not bypass promotion or find fabricated attribution.
  **Remaining: wire both into the orchestrator's resolved-trade stream (a follow-up) + drive a
  real alpha through them once one exists.**
- Why / next: the binding constraint is unchanged and loop-buildable — a real decision-time alpha
  forming model_prob != crowd on LESS-PINNED markets. The measurement + governance apparatus is
  now stronger (hardened screen, p-hack-resistant calibration gate, lifecycle registry, per-strategy
  attribution). Next run: WIRE the engines + start the alpha. No DoD/floor box ticked.

## 2026-06-29 — WIRED the learning-loop engines + honest cost-arb + E5/E2 engines (5-PR run)
- Hypothesis (falsifiable): (a) per-strategy attribution (E6) + the alpha-lifecycle registry (B3) can be
  wired into the orchestrator + persisted without breaking determinism or the gate; (b) the only true
  logical-arbitrage strategy (SameMarketArbitrage) can be made HONEST by costing the basket through the
  canonical cost model; (c) two new pure learning-loop engines (E5 window engine, E2 drift detector) can
  be built deterministic + significance-honest offline.
- Min sample N: n/a (wiring + infra + correctness; no alpha eval). E2's significance gate measured at a
  false-positive rate of 1.3–3.7% on same-distribution noise (vs 46.7% for a raw point comparison).
- OOS result: n/a — no edge claimed. No DoD/floor box ticked. The binding constraint (a real
  model_prob != crowd alpha on less-pinned markets) is UNCHANGED.
- Costs modeled: yes — the SameMarketArbitrage edge is now `1.0 - Σ effective_buy_price(outcome)` (the
  same multiplicative slippage+fee execution.py charges), replacing an optimistic flat `discount - 0.02`.
- Verdict: promoted (wiring + correctness + learning-loop infra; 4 file-disjoint code PRs + bookkeeping;
  2 Sonnet reviewers + 3 fresh Opus auditors; one consolidated fix cycle).
- **THE adversarial lesson (an Opus auditor BROKE the cost-arb "guaranteed edge" claim):** the
  SameMarketArbitrage "buy all outcomes → guaranteed $1" is NOT a locked arbitrage as wired: (1) the
  multi-outcome branch had no MECE check, so it could fire on a non-exhaustive candidate list where
  "exactly one pays $1" is false — FIXED by gating the multi-outcome branch on `market.neg_risk` (binary
  markets are MECE by construction); (2) `outcome.price` is the CLOB MIDPOINT, not the ask you'd pay, and
  the flat 0.5% slippage ≠ the real half-spread, so a fired signal is a candidate to verify against live
  depth, not locked profit — now disclosed honestly; (3) the orchestrator's `outcome_idx=-1` path records
  ONE phantom fill (empty token_id) instead of placing a real per-leg order each — a PRE-EXISTING execution
  defect, logged as the named B-track follow-up (per-leg ask-priced execution). **Lesson: a "guaranteed
  arbitrage" is only real if (a) the outcomes are provably MECE, (b) you price the ASK with real book
  depth, and (c) you actually place + confirm each leg separately. Costing the basket honestly is necessary
  but NOT sufficient; disclose the midpoint/MECE/execution gaps rather than ship a half-true "guaranteed".**
- **Honesty fix #2 (B3 promotion gate):** the registry gates on the PRESENCE of caller-supplied
  backtest/OOS/calibration booleans — it is an audit trail, NOT an authenticity verifier. An auditor showed
  a 4-call walk could reach PROMOTED with fabricated evidence via the planned POST endpoint. FIXED by NOT
  exposing a public write endpoint this run (GET read only); real transitions are recorded only by trusted
  in-process code once it DERIVES evidence from the actual E5/E2 gate results (named follow-up). DECISION
  COROLLARY: don't expose a control whose authenticity-backing isn't built.
- **BUILDS≠WORKS catch (reviewer):** the B3 registry seeding was a silent no-op in the normal API path
  (the orchestrator is constructed with scanner=None, so it seeded empty and never re-seeded). FIXED with
  an idempotent `sync_registry_with_scanner()` called after the scanner attaches (verified it now seeds the
  deployed strategies as PROPOSED — the honest "no alpha has passed the gate" state).
- Why / next: the governance + measurement loop is now WIRED (attribution endpoint, persisted lifecycle
  registry, drawdown-on-resolution risk fix) and two new learning engines (window + drift) exist pure.
  Next: derive real B3 evidence from E5/E2 + per-leg arb execution + the real alpha. Binding constraint
  unchanged; egress (OA-11) remains owner-scope.

## 2026-06-29 — Research Run 8: EXP-002 proposed (Horizon-Effect Calibration Bias); fixture calibration audit; academic synthesis

- Hypothesis (falsifiable): Binary Polymarket markets with YES probability 65–90% at 7 days to
  resolution are systematically UNDERPRICED vs their empirical resolution rate — the crowd
  UNDER-ASSIGNS probability to favorites at early horizons (calibration slope > 1.0) — and this
  gap survives realistic costs (2% fee + 0.5% slippage). A `CalibrationBucketStrategy` that
  replaces crowd_prob with empirically fitted per-bucket resolution rates (trained on the oldest
  60% of a 7-day-lead corpus) produces a positive net Brier improvement on the OOS 40%.
- Min sample N: 100 resolved markets with YES ∈ [0.65, 0.90] at 7-day decision_lead; ≥30 per
  bucket for any bucket-level claim. Total corpus ≥200 records across all price ranges.
- OOS result: **insufficient data** — the committed 54-record fixture was built with a 2-day
  decision_lead (all records at 48h), so ~70% of markets were already price-pinned at decision
  time. Walk-forward still makes 0 trades (model_prob == crowd by construction — the fetcher
  seeds model_prob to the crowd price; no independent model exists yet). The 7-day-lead corpus
  needed for EXP-002 requires re-running OA-11 with `--decision-lead-days 7` (the script's
  default — NO code changes needed; it already accepts this flag).
- Calibration (Brier / reliability): Fixture-level audit of the 54 records revealed: the crowd
  UNDERPRICES YES in ALL price buckets at 48h. Most striking: 34 near-certainty-NO markets
  (price < 0.10) had avg_price=0.008 vs yes_rate=0.059 (crowd said 0.8%, empirical 5.9%).
  Binomial p-value ≈ 0.029 under null (crowd correct). **Treated as a HYPOTHESIS, not an edge:**
  N=34 with ~2 YES resolutions is too small; in-sample look; sample is biased toward high-volume
  political/election markets. "Insufficient data" — needs OOS validation with ≥100 records in
  this bucket. This direction (near-certainty-NO markets resolving YES) is the INVERSE of EXP-001
  (which tested near-certainty-YES markets over-pricing YES). Both hypotheses need empirical
  calibration before any edge claim.
- Costs modeled: 2% fee + 0.5% slippage (cost_model.py). At near-zero prices (< 0.01), the
  payoff structure is highly asymmetric — a fill at 0.8¢ theoretically gets a 124x payout on a
  YES, but real bid-ask spread + market-impact on illiquid near-zero tokens may be 5-10% of face
  value, erasing the edge entirely.
- Verdict: **proposed** (EXP-002; see GROWTH_STATUS experiments[])
- Why / next: research (external sources, Le 2026 calibration decomposition on 210K+ Kalshi
  contracts; PolyBench LLM-ensemble benchmarks 2025-2026; 3%-of-traders price-discovery study
  2026) + fixture analysis converge on the same conclusion: **the current 54-record corpus is
  too near-resolution and too volume-biased to test any calibration hypothesis**. The existing
  infrastructure is complete (fetcher already has `--decision-lead-days` flag, B2 eval exists,
  walk_forward exists, CalibrationBucketStrategy is unbuilt but trivial once data arrives). The
  single highest-EV owner action is re-running OA-11 with 7-day decision_lead to unlock all
  calibration alphas at once.

### Academic + empirical findings this run (DATA; none are claimed edges)
- **Le 2026 (Kalshi, 210K+ contracts):** calibration slope rises from 0.99 (< 1h to resolution)
  to 1.32 (> 1 month). A market at 70¢ one month out reflects ~75% true probability → favorites
  systematically UNDERPRICED far from resolution. Consistent with the 54-record data (crowd
  underprices YES at all price levels at 48h). **Cannot directly extrapolate to Polymarket** —
  market microstructure and liquidity profiles differ. Needs Polymarket-specific validation.
- **3%-of-traders study (CoinDesk 2026):** only ~3% of Polymarket traders drive price discovery.
  Implication: in LOW-VOLUME markets, those 3% may not have traded yet → wider miscalibration
  window than in large markets. Consistent with the "volume proxy for informed trading" hypothesis.
  **How it could be wrong:** the 3% may include market makers (price-neutral), not alpha-bearing
  informed traders; survivorship bias in the analysis.
- **PolyBench / Prophet Arena (2025-2026):** LLM ensembles match human market accuracy with
  realized returns, edge coming from "losing less when wrong." **Supports B4 (LLM-assessed
  probability) as a viable alpha direction.** But B4 remains formally gated on B2 producing a
  PASSING eval on real resolved-market probabilities.
- **Liquidity ≠ Calibration (3,587 markets, 2025):** spread compression 43% from institutional
  entry, but calibration does NOT improve. Liquidity affects execution cost, not forecast
  accuracy. Illiquid markets are not necessarily less efficient — they may just be harder to
  predict, not miscalibrated. CONSERVATIVE implication: don't assume low-volume = mispriced.

### How EXP-002 could be wrong (adversarial pre-mortem)
1. At 7 days to resolution on high-volume markets, the crowd already incorporates 99% of public
   information → calibration slope near 1.0 even at 7 days (not 1.32). Only the VERY early
   (<30 day) low-volume markets show the bias.
2. The Le 2026 effect is KALSHI-specific: Kalshi's regulated, US-focused user base has different
   calibration patterns than Polymarket's crypto-native international user base.
3. Slippage at 7 days is materially higher than at 2 days (wider spreads, less depth) → the 0.5%
   slippage model underestimates costs, erasing the edge.
4. Per-bucket calibration fitting on the training set may overfit with N < 50/bucket — the OOS
   rates will revert toward the crowd's prices.
5. The horizon effect is priced in by sophisticated arbitrageurs who exploit it continuously →
   by the time we see the opportunity, the edge is gone.

### Candidate alphas NOT proposed this run (reasons)
- **Near-certainty-NO longshot reversal:** The fixture hint (0.8% stated vs 5.9% empirical) is
  intriguing but in-sample on N=34 with ~2 YES outcomes. "Insufficient data." Revisit once OA-11
  delivers a purpose-sampled near-certainty-NO corpus (target: 100+ records with price < 0.10).
- **Per-market LLM research (B4):** Gated on B2 producing a passing eval first — per ROADMAP.
  Also, cost per market ($0.30-0.50) must clear the EV bar per trade. Revisit after EXP-002
  delivers the first calibration baseline.
- **Cross-platform arb (Polymarket/Kalshi):** Still speed-dominated (tightest gaps close within
  seconds per 2026 reports). Insufficient data on whether the bot can execute fast enough.
